#+TITLE: Bomberman code design

* Project
** Phase 1: Destroy walls and look for exit
   - Randomly distributed walls
   - Exit is not hidden by wall, but way to exit is obstructed by walls
** Phase 2: Destroy walls and look for exit w/ monster
   - Board with W x H cells
   - Randomly distributed walls
   - Exit is not hidden by wall, but way to exit is obstructed by walls
   - Monster moves randomly or towards AI
** Phase 3: Kill other AI
   - Board with W x H cells
   - Randomly distributed walls
   - 2-4 players, monsters can be present or not

* Design
** World
   - *Grid:* ~w~ x ~h~ cells
   - *Cell:* each cell stores /nothing/ (~0~), /wall/ (~1~), /bomb/ (~2~), /explosion/ (~3~), /character/ (>= ~4~)
   - *Explosion:* /delay/ (steps), /duration/ (steps), /range/ (cells)
** Board generation
   - *Characters:* start each at one corner, at random
   - *Exit:* located at equal and maximum Manhattan distance to each character
   - *Monsters:* randomly added in the middle of the arena
   - *Walls:*
       - little "fort" around each character
       - uniform-randomly added lines of walls (length, direction, start chosen at random)
** Monster
   - Chooses randomly between going to the character (~gotocharacter~) and moving at random (~wander~)
   - Parameter: how long to perform either choice
** Agent
   - *Sensing:* Has access to state of the entire board (read-only)
   - *Actions:*
       - *Move:* up/down/left/right
       - *Bomb:* place bomb
** Game over
   - *Win:* one character arrives at exit cell
   - *Lose:*
       - last character is on an explosion cell
       - last character and monster are at the same cell
** Progress for a Character
   - *Phase 1,2:* $(1000 - \text{distance to wall}) + \text{no. of destroyed walls}$
   - *Phase 3:* $1000 \times \text{characters who dies before this one}$
